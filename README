# First thing would be to clone this repository.

# Set up a virtual environment to help isolate dependencies.
virtualenv env

# First we'll install ga4gh
pip install ga4gh

# Next, we want to use jupyter and matplotlib we're going to use them
# for the client part of the demo.
pip install jupyter matplotlib

# We need to initialize the registry for this server instance.

# on my machine I'd like to use. I haven't inspected what references the other
# data are mapped to, so hopefully we get lucky with NCBI37.

# Since I don't have hive I'll build out what I can figure out from the paths and
# see if it works tomorrow.

# I'm pretty confident I can use the 1kgenomes VCF, at least phase-3, without issue.
# Sometimes, certain files might need to be masked, in which case we'll add them by file.
